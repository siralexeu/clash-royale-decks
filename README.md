## 🎮 How It Works

### 🔨 Deck Builder - Create New Decks

The main page where you build your decks:

1. **Select a slot** - Click on one of the 8 empty slots
2. **Choose a card** - Scroll down and search for the desired card in the list
3. **Click on card** - The card automatically appears in the selected slot
4. **Repeat** - The next empty slot is automatically selected
5. **View elixir average** - Calculated automatically as you add cards

**Useful features:**
- **Quick search** - Type the card name in the search bar
- **Drag & Drop** - Drag cards between slots to rearrange them
- **Clear Deck** - Delete all cards and start from scratch
- **Export Deck** - When you have 8 cards, add a name and press "Export Deck" to download the JSON

### 💾 My Decks - Your Saved Decks

Here you'll find all the decks you've saved:

- **View all decks** - Each deck displays the name, 8 cards, and elixir average
- **Load into builder** - Click on a deck to open it in Deck Builder
- **Modify** - After loading a deck, you can change cards and export again

### 🃏 All Cards - All Cards

Complete gallery with all 164 available cards (125 normal cards + 39 evolutions):

- **Explore cards** - View all cards from the game in an organized grid
- **Search** - Quickly find any card by name
- **Special cards** - Evolutions, Legendaries, and Heroes have larger sizes to be easily identified

## 📝 Typical Workflow

### First Time Use

1. Enter the site → see the **Deck Builder** page
2. Explore available cards in the bottom grid
3. Create your first deck by selecting 8 cards
4. Click **Export Deck** and save the JSON to your PC

### Permanent Save

For the deck to appear in **My Decks**, you need to add the exported JSON to the `decks.json` file in the repository. After doing this and refreshing the page, the deck will appear saved.

### Daily Usage

1. **Explore** - Go to "My Decks" to see all your strategies
2. **Modify** - Click on a deck → it loads in builder → change the cards
3. **Test** - Create variants of the same deck with different cards
4. **Organize** - Export the new versions and save them
